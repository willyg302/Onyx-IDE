ONYX CHANGELOG
--------------

[ Feb 17 2012 ]
 - Overhauled GUIProperties system to make it easier to manage themes. Now to add a theme, all you have to do is add to the defaults[][] array.

[ Feb 18 2012 ]
 - Added UScriptTokenMaker.java and modified UnrealTab.java.
 - Added UnrealScript syntax highlighting with over 300 keywords.
 - Removed dependency on JAlbum. This was done by adding the following classes: IO, JStackLabel, RiverLayout, StringCodec, and ToggleAction.
 - Cleaned out references to JAlbum and unused references.

[ Feb 19 2012 ]
 - Added autoCompletion.setParameterAssistanceEnabled(true); which enables function parameter help.
 - Made PC/UNIX line termination style a per-tab option, rather than a global option. Each tab instance now keeps its own selection.
 - Fixed bug where opening a new file would not update the Termination Style radio buttons.

[ Feb 26 2012 ]
 - Moved Work In Progress message screen to showWIP() function.

[ Feb 29 2012 ]

[ Mar 04 2012 ]
 - Refined CmdClient.java to handle multiple arguments.
 - Gave entire UDK menu functionality (including checks for directory and file-safe actions).

 - Added Frontend icon.

[ Mar 07 2012 ]
 - Added feature that changes tab text color to red and appends * if tab content is changed.
 - Changed tabOptions saving to integer instead by converting boolean array to bit string and then to int. Added two utility conversion functions to handle this.
