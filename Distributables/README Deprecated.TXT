ONYX UnrealScript IDE
---------------------

Copyright 2012 by WillyG Productions.

Uses RSyntaxTextArea, JTattoo, and portions of code from JAlbum text editor.

Onyx will create a file userSettings.onyx in your home directory. DO NOT modify this file. Doing so may cause Onyx to crash. If you feel this file is corrupted, delete it to revert Onyx back to its default settings (you will lose custom theme and display settings).
