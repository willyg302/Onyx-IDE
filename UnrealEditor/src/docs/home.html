        <p><font size="5">What is Onyx?</font></p>
        <font size = "3">
            <p>Onyx is a cross-platform UnrealScript editor written in Java. It is designed with ease-of-use and portability in mind, requiring very little memory and capable of running on any machine with a JVM installed.</p>
        </font>
        <p><font size="5">Why Choose Onyx?</font></p>
        <font size = "3">
            <p>Whether you work on the PC or the Mac, the Onyx experience won't change. That's because Onyx was build around the idea of cross-platform support: there's no installer or Mac disk image, just a Java distributable. You place the folder where you want it, maybe create a shortcut to the JAR that you can stick in the Start Menu or Applications stack, and that's it.</p>
            <p>Onyx is far from becoming a robust "industry standard" editor, but feedback from the gaming community is sure to change that quickly. And not only do I welcome feedback, if there are any questions or problems I am willing to help solve them.</p>
            <p>Oh, and did I mention...Onyx is free?</p>
